# minecraftSaveBackUper
Backs up Minecraft Java Edition world saves of your choosing

When you first run this, you will have to manually give the locations of your world saves and desktop.
After the first time, you wont have to input the locations. This program will ask what world to back up, 
then find the save folder, copy it to the desktop, then create a zip of the folder on the desktop.
